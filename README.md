A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications - with Angular JS.

No live demo yet..

I really like the work by Sahat Yalkabov with https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter
Even though I know there are several node-express-angular-mongodb boilerplates out there, here's my contribution. I wanted to be able to mix Angular and static pages in a single site. Also, I prefer to split Angular actions into separate modules.

### Routes are by default static and serve jade templates. To "angularify" a route:
1. Create an angular module for it (see public/js/modules.api.js)
... angular.module('myApp.modules.api', [])
...
...$routeProvider
... .when('/api', {
...	templateUrl: 'views/api.html',

2. Create an HTML partial in public/views/ which Angular can deliver

3. Add angularApp to the view data of the route's callback as such
... exports.getApi = function(req, res) {
...   res.render('api/index', {
...   title: 'API Browser'
...	  ,angularApp: 'myApp'
...  });
... };

Legacy browsers and crawlers will still be served static HTML while newer browsers will show your interactive HTML 5 web app.
